## Biorhythm Version 3\.0


</div>

### Description

Biorhythm V3.0 is a great code to generate Biorhythmic Waves/Cycles. It produces 10 types of biorhythmic waves (cycles)(which are Emotional Physical Intellectual Passion Mastery Wisdom Aesthetic Intutive Self-Awareness and Spiritual). There has been a lot of changes from the pervious version (v2.5). i have added a small help on Understanding Biorhythm and Add remove user name option. Also the interface has been changed.

CREDITS: well, i would like to thank Clint LaFever , korejwa and others to take pain for giving me suggestions (by posting msgs and sending mails).
